                    <p><em>Mechanical Engineer at <strong>Newt Mobility</strong>.</em></p>
                    <p>I am a mechanical engineer by training, but in practice, I split my work between traditional mechanical engineering, electronics, embedded programming, user interface design, and web development. I have a passion for making the world a safer, cleaner, and happier place. My ultimate goal in life is to know that my time has been well-spent, and that my work has made people's lives better.</p>
